## Package structure

- [Package Structure Guide](https://github.com/voedger/kb/issues/45)
- `requirements.md` MUST comply with the [requirements.md](writing-guidelines.md#requirements-and-design-files) guidelines

---

## Testing

### `testdata` directory

Test data MUST be stored in the `testdata` directory. The `testdata` directory name is reserved by the Go toolchain. Files in this directory are ignored during build and analysis, making it suitable for test fixtures, including Go source files.

### Black-box testing

Tests SHOULD be implemented in the `<package-name>_test` package to adhere to the black-box testing principles.

### Testable examples

Testable examples MAY be provided to demonstrate code usage:

- [Official Go Examples Guide](https://go.dev/blog/examples)
- [Example: binary package tests](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.20.5:src/encoding/binary/example_test.go)
- [Example: `binary.Write`](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary#example-Write)
- [Example: `in10nmem` tests](https://github.com/voedger/voedger/blob/15ef848eecdc1950a6eba71732991012d509be18/pkg/in10nmem/example_test.go#L21)

---

## Construction

### Anti-patterns

The following anti-patterns MUST be avoided:

- Busy Waiting (Spin Waiting)
- Goroutine/Task/Thread Leaks
- Heap Escapes Without Reuse (critical in hot paths)

### Concurrency review

All implementations involving concurrency patterns (goroutines, sync package) MUST undergo both human and AI-assisted code review. See [example review](https://github.com/voedger/kb/issues/57).

### Avoid commented-out and dead code

Commented-out code and dead code MUST be removed from the codebase.

### Avoid tightly coupling between packages

Loose coupling between packages, including test suites, MUST be maintained.

For dependency injection testing:

**In the interface package:**

- Declare the interface (`IElections`) and all possible injections (`ITTLStorage`).
- Create an interface test suite (e.g., `IElectionsTestSuite`).
- Create mock implementations for all possible injections.
- Create a reference implementation for the interface.
- Use `IElectionsTestSuite` to test the reference implementation.

**In packages that inject dependencies:**

- Use `IElectionsTestSuite` to test the implementation with specific injections.

## Scripts

- `.cmd` files MUST NOT be used for scripts. Use `.sh` or `.bash`
