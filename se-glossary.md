# Glossary

**Backpressure** is a feedback mechanism where downstream components signal their processing capacity limits to upstream components, causing them to slow down or modify their data transmission rate to prevent system overload.

**Circuit breakers** are software components that monitor system failures and automatically prevent further requests to a failing service for a set time period, allowing it to recover while providing immediate fallback responses to clients.

**Design** is the process of crafting solutions by organizing elements to meet specific goals.

**Polling** is a technique where a system repeatedly checks for state changes, data availability, or conditions at fixed intervals rather than receiving notifications when changes occur.

**Software Design**
    - v1. is the process of blueprinting defining software architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics to satisfy specified requirements. It includes making decisions about software design patterns, algorithms, data structures, and more.
    - v2. detailed implementation of the software, including the selection of algorithms, data structures, and modules to fulfill the architecture's specifications.
