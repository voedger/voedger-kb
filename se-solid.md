# SOLID principles

SOLID stands for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

Details:

- **S**ingle-responsibility principle (SRP) states that "there should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- **D**ependency inversion principle (DIP) states to depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes.
