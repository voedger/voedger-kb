# SWEBOK

- The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide), published by the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS), represents the current state of generally accepted, consensus-based knowledge emanating from the interplay between software engineering theory and practice. Its objectives include the provision of guidance for learners, researchers, and practitioners to identify and share a common understanding of “generally accepted knowledge” in software engineering, defining the boundary between software engineering and related disciplines, and providing a foundation for certifications and educational curricula.

## Architecture

Definition1:

> **Architecture** (of a (sub)system). Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution.
> Key ideas in that definition are the following
>
> - **(1)** Architecture is about what is *fundamental* to a software system; not every element, interconnection, or interface is considered fundamental.
> - **(2)** Architecture considers a system *in its environment*. Much like building architecture, software architecture is outward-looking; it considers a system’s context beyond its boundaries including the people, organizations, software, hardware and other devices with which the system must interact.
>
> *SWEEBOK*

Definition2:
> Architecture is the aspect of a system's design that allows to understand the system's guiding principles, major components, interactions and behavior.
>
> *maxim-ge*

## Design

Definition1:

> **Software Design** is a practical process of transforming a problem statement into a solution statement.
>
>*SWEEBOK*

Definition2:

>**Software design** is the transformation of customer and other requirements, needs, and concerns into implementable design specifications.
